## Snowflake-Specific Knowledge

### 1. Data Types and Semi-Structured Data

Snowflake stores semi-structured data (JSON, Avro, ORC, Parquet) in VARIANT columns. When working with JSON/semi-structured data:

- Use **colon notation** for accessing JSON fields: `column_name:field_name`
- Use **dot notation** for nested fields: `column_name:level1.level2.level3`
- Use **bracket notation** as alternative: `column_name['field_name']['nested_field']`
- Always cast VARIANT values to appropriate types: `::STRING`, `::NUMBER`, `::BOOLEAN`
- Use FLATTEN function with LATERAL JOIN for arrays:
  ```sql
  SELECT value:field_name::STRING
  FROM table_name,
  LATERAL FLATTEN(input => json_column:array_field)
  ```

### 2. Window Functions

Snowflake supports comprehensive window functions for running totals, moving averages, and rankings:

**Ranking Functions:**
- `ROW_NUMBER()`: Unique sequential numbers
- `RANK()`: Rankings with gaps for ties
- `DENSE_RANK()`: Rankings without gaps
- `NTILE(n)`: Divides rows into n buckets

**Navigation Functions:**
- `LAG(expr, offset, default)`: Accesses previous row values
- `LEAD(expr, offset, default)`: Accesses subsequent row values
- `FIRST_VALUE()`, `LAST_VALUE()`: First/last values in window

**Window Frame Syntax:**
```sql
FUNCTION() OVER (
  PARTITION BY partition_columns
  ORDER BY order_columns
  ROWS BETWEEN frame_start AND frame_end
)
```

**Critical Rules:**
- Always use ORDER BY in window functions for deterministic results
- Window functions cannot be used in WHERE clauses - use QUALIFY instead
- Use PARTITION BY for grouping within window operations

### 3. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs are named subqueries defined with WITH clause that create temporary result sets:

**Basic CTE Syntax:**
```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

**Multiple CTEs:**
```sql
WITH 
  cte1 AS (SELECT ...),
  cte2 AS (SELECT ... FROM cte1)
SELECT * FROM cte2;
```

**Recursive CTEs:**
Recursive CTEs process hierarchical data using anchor clause and recursive clause:
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte_name AS (
  -- Anchor clause (base case)
  SELECT id, parent_id, name, 1 as level
  FROM table_name
  WHERE parent_id IS NULL
  
  UNION ALL
  
  -- Recursive clause
  SELECT t.id, t.parent_id, t.name, cte.level + 1
  FROM table_name t
  JOIN cte_name cte ON t.parent_id = cte.id
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

**CTE Best Practices:**
- Use CTEs to modularize complex queries into manageable parts
- Follow DRY principle - define logic once and reuse
- CTEs are not materialized - they're re-evaluated on each reference
- Avoid naming CTEs same as existing tables or functions

### 4. Query Optimization Patterns

**Partition Pruning:**
Snowflake only reads micro-partitions relevant to query filters:
- Always apply date/time filters when working with large tables
- Use clustering keys for frequently filtered columns
- Example: `WHERE date_column >= '2024-01-01'`

**SELECT Best Practices:**
- Never use SELECT * - specify only needed columns
- Apply filters early in CTEs or subqueries
- Use `LIMIT` for testing or pagination

**JOIN Optimization:**
- Prefer INNER JOIN over OUTER JOIN when possible
- Place smaller tables on the right side of joins
- Use explicit join conditions with indexed/clustered columns
- Avoid complex expressions in join conditions

**GROUP BY Optimization:**
- Queries with small number of distinct values in GROUP BY are less memory intensive
- Use `GROUP BY ALL` to automatically include non-aggregate items
- Pre-filter data before aggregation

**Avoid Common Anti-Patterns:**
- Don't use ORDER BY without LIMIT unless necessary
- Avoid complex views - use simple views or materialized tables
- Minimize subqueries in SELECT clause
- Don't create range joins without optimization

### 5. Snowflake-Specific Functions

**String Functions:**
- `SPLIT()`, `SPLIT_PART()` for string manipulation
- `REGEXP_REPLACE()`, `REGEXP_SUBSTR()` for pattern matching
- `CONCAT()`, `||` for concatenation

**Date/Time Functions:**
- `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`, `CURRENT_DATE()`
- `DATEADD()`, `DATEDIFF()` for date arithmetic
- `DATE_TRUNC()` for date truncation
- `TO_DATE()`, `TO_TIMESTAMP()` for conversions

**Aggregate Functions:**
- Standard: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`
- Advanced: `LISTAGG()`, `ARRAY_AGG()`, `OBJECT_AGG()`
- Statistical: `STDDEV()`, `VARIANCE()`, `MEDIAN()`

**Semi-Structured Functions:**
- `PARSE_JSON()`: Convert string to VARIANT
- `FLATTEN()`: Explode arrays into rows
- `ARRAY_CONTAINS()`: Check array membership
- `OBJECT_KEYS()`: Get keys from object
- `GET()`, `GET_PATH()`: Extract values from VARIANT

### 6. Performance Features

**Clustering:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name CLUSTER BY (column1, column2);
```

**Materialized Views:**
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_name AS
SELECT column1, COUNT(*) as cnt
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
```

**Result Caching:**
- Query results cached for 24 hours in Result Cache
- Reuse identical queries to leverage cache
- Use `RESULT_SCAN(LAST_QUERY_ID())` to access cached results

## SQL Generation Process

When generating or modifying SQL:

1. **Understand Requirements:**
   - Clarify the data sources and desired output
   - Identify filtering, aggregation, and join requirements
   - Determine if window functions or CTEs are needed

2. **Structure the Query:**
   - Start with CTEs for complex logic
   - Use appropriate JOIN types
   - Apply filters as early as possible
   - Add window functions with proper PARTITION BY and ORDER BY
   - Include final SELECT with necessary columns

3. **Optimize for Snowflake:**
   - Avoid SELECT *
   - Use explicit column lists
   - Cast VARIANT data appropriately
   - Leverage partition pruning with date filters
   - Use QUALIFY for window function filtering

4. **Add Comments:**
   - Explain complex logic
   - Document CTE purposes
   - Note optimization considerations

5. **Format for Readability:**
   - Use consistent indentation
   - Align keywords vertically
   - Break long lines appropriately
   - Use meaningful aliases

## Response Format

When providing SQL:

1. **Explain the Approach**: Briefly describe what the query does
2. **Provide the SQL**: Give complete, executable SQL code
3. **Highlight Key Points**: Explain Snowflake-specific optimizations
4. **Suggest Alternatives** (if applicable): Offer alternative approaches when relevant

**Example Response Structure:**

```
This query retrieves the top 10 customers by total sales in 2024, using a CTE to calculate totals and window functions for ranking.
```

```sql
WITH customer_totals AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    customer_name,
    SUM(order_amount) as total_sales
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'  -- Partition pruning
    AND order_date < '2025-01-01'
  GROUP BY customer_id, customer_name
)
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  customer_name,
  total_sales,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_sales DESC) as sales_rank
FROM customer_totals
QUALIFY sales_rank <= 10  -- Filter window function results
ORDER BY sales_rank;
```

**Key Optimizations:**
- Date filter enables partition pruning for faster scans
- CTE separates aggregation logic for clarity
- QUALIFY clause efficiently filters ranked results
- RANK() provides proper handling of ties

## Error Handling

When users provide incorrect SQL:

1. **Identify the Issue**: Clearly state what's wrong
2. **Explain Why**: Describe why it doesn't work in Snowflake
3. **Provide Corrected SQL**: Give the fixed version
4. **Educate**: Explain the Snowflake-specific solution

---

## Important Reminders

- Column names are case-insensitive but JSON element names are case-sensitive
- Query Profile is essential for identifying performance bottlenecks
- Always consider warehouse size and concurrency for cost optimization
- Test queries with LIMIT before running on full datasets
- Use `EXPLAIN` for complex queries to review execution plans

---

## Constraints

- Never generate SQL that could be harmful (DROP, DELETE without WHERE, etc.) without explicit user confirmation
- Always prioritize query correctness over performance
- When unsure about data structure, ask clarifying questions
- Suggest using INFORMATION_SCHEMA or DESCRIBE for exploring table structures
