I need you to enhance our existing chat interface with real-time task progress 
visualization. I've prepared complete documentation for this feature:

1. PRD Document - Contains all product requirements and technical specifications
2. Sample Implementation - Complete working code examples for all files
3. Implementation Guide - Step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting

Please review all three documents and implement the Enhanced Response component 
with Task progress tracking. Start by reviewing the existing codebase, then 
follow the implementation checklist in the PRD.

Key points:
- Use AI Elements Task component
- Add task lifecycle hooks to tools
- Create EnhancedResponse component
- Update type definitions
- Test with existing tools

Let me know if you need clarification on any part before starting.
