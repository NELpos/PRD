# Task: Enhance Chat Interface with Real-Time Task Progress

## Overview
I need you to add real-time task progress visualization to our existing chat interface using AI Elements Task component. This is an ENHANCEMENT to existing code, not a new project.

## üö® CRITICAL: Start with Analysis, NOT Coding

**DO NOT write any code until you complete the analysis phase.**

### Phase 0: Codebase Analysis (Required First Step)

1. **Explore the entire project structure**
   ```bash
   tree -L 3
   # or
   find . -type f -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" | head -30
   ```

2. **Locate these critical files:**
   - [ ] Main chat interface component (where useChat is used)
   - [ ] API route handling chat requests
   - [ ] Current Response component usage
   - [ ] Type definitions location
   - [ ] Existing tool definitions
   - [ ] AI Elements components location

3. **Document your findings:**
   Create a file called `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with:
   - Current project structure
   - Paths to all key files
   - Import patterns (@ / ~ / relative)
   - Naming conventions
   - Styling approach
   - Existing tools list

4. **Share your analysis with me before proceeding**
   Show me your `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` so we can confirm you understand the structure correctly.

## Documentation Provided

I've prepared three comprehensive documents:

### 1. PRD Document
- Product requirements and specifications
- **Includes emphasis on adapting to existing codebase**
- Implementation phases with detailed checklist
- Success criteria

### 2. Sample Implementation Code
- Reference implementations for all components
- **These are TEMPLATES - adapt to our codebase, don't copy-paste**
- Shows the pattern and data flow
- Demonstrates correct API usage

### 3. Implementation Guide
- Step-by-step instructions
- **Emphasizes analysis-first approach**
- Troubleshooting tips
- Testing checklist

## Key Principles

1. ‚úÖ **Understand first, code second**
2. ‚úÖ **Adapt sample code to match existing patterns**
3. ‚úÖ **Extend existing types, don't create parallel ones**
4. ‚úÖ **Follow project's conventions exactly**
5. ‚úÖ **Preserve all existing functionality**
6. ‚úÖ **Test incrementally**

## What I Expect

### First Response: Your Analysis
Please respond with:
```markdown
# Codebase Analysis Complete

## Project Structure
- Framework: [Next.js App Router / Pages / Other]
- Components: [path]
- API Routes: [path]
- Types: [path]

## Key Files Located
- Chat Component: [exact path]
- API Endpoint: [exact path]
- Response Component: [path]
- Types: [path]

## Code Patterns
- Import alias: [@ / ~ / relative]
- Naming: [convention]
- Exports: [default / named]
- Styling: [approach]

## Existing Tools
1. [tool name] - [file location]
2. [tool name] - [file location]

## Implementation Strategy
Based on this structure, I will:
1. [specific file] - [what I'll do]
2. [specific file] - [what I'll do]
3. [specific file] - [what I'll do]

## Questions / Concerns
- [any uncertainties about the codebase]
- [any potential conflicts]
```

### After Analysis Approval: Implementation
Only after I approve your analysis, proceed with:
1. Installing Task component
2. Updating types
3. Modifying API route
4. Creating EnhancedResponse
5. Updating chat component

## Expected Outcome

Users should see:
- Real-time task cards during tool execution
- Status indicators (pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed)
- Progress updates streaming in
- Expandable/collapsible task details
- All existing chat functionality preserved

## What NOT to Do

‚ùå Don't start coding immediately
‚ùå Don't copy-paste sample code without adapting
‚ùå Don't create new folder structures
‚ùå Don't change existing file organization
‚ùå Don't skip the analysis phase
‚ùå Don't break existing functionality

## What TO Do

‚úÖ Analyze the codebase thoroughly first
‚úÖ Adapt all sample code to match our patterns
‚úÖ Follow existing conventions
‚úÖ Test after each change
‚úÖ Ask questions if uncertain
‚úÖ Document your changes

## Questions Before Starting?

Before you begin the analysis, do you have any questions about:
- The task requirements?
- The expected approach?
- The documentation provided?
- What I'm looking for in your analysis?

Please start by exploring the codebase and providing your analysis. I'll review it before you proceed with implementation.
